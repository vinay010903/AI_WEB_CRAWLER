The important point is that the item is non returnable. I am not sure whether it was mentioned in the product page, anyway it was not prominently given and so I missed it.  My suggestion would that it is better buy after physically wearing and trying in a shop.  In fact AMAZON should not sell those items which are not returnable.",

If you have a tummy( like me, I call it a \"family pack\" and I'm on a journey to transform it to a \"six pack\" :P)  it might be a little bit uncomfortable initially but you will get used to it. It fits well but like I said if you have a tummy you might feel it's so tight and I believe it should be tight otherwise it will defeat the purpose of the belt.It comes with a booklet containing information about types of back pain, causes, exercises to tackle the pain and the like. it is very informative and I loved it.. :)An important point to be noted: I was wearing it wrong this whole time. There is a tag on the belt I've attached a pic of it, look at that pic and wear it properly.The stitch of the  velcro attached on the outer belt came off withing couple of uses. And the outer belt will curl up, which is annoying, but these are not deal breakers. It will do what it is supposed to do.Pros:1. It gives excellent back support.2. It will help you with your posture( I've a very bad posture and it helped me stay upright, but that is a temporary fix; mind you. Ultimately you got to take conscious effort to correct your posture)CONS:1. The stitching of the velcro not up to the mark.2. Found it uncomfortable to wear for a long timeOverall it's a nice product...If anything else comes up will update.. Stay healthy, stay happy...",

However, I am yet to receive any feedback from them as to whether they can modify the one I purchased or think about implementing the suggestions. The suggestions were briefly as goes:1. The inner belt could have been wider.2. Hook patches on both and inner and outer belts should have been full length. This would have ensured more area of grip for the hook-loop pairs, reduced localised stresses as seen on inner belt and avoided coiling of the inner belt end and protrusion of the outer belt end. If worn below shirt, the protrusion of the outer belt sometimes jutts out of gap between two buttons or creates a \"tent\"effect.",
